<h1>Emotion Reader</h1>

This project showcases a machine learning model built with Teachable Machine and implemented using JavaScript. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning can be used to recognize and classify different types of images, such as handwritten digits or facial expressions. By leveraging the power of Teachable Machine and the flexibility of JavaScript, we were able to create a highly accurate and responsive machine learning model that can be easily integrated into a wide range of applications
